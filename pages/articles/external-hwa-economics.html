excerpt: About a year ago, I ran a Kickstarter for Hello Web App â€” and now that the book has officially launched, I thought it would be useful to run down how much money the Kickstarter raised and where it went! Note: There will be another post after this one covering setting up the campaign and the regrets I have about the rewards and other details, but the economics of a project is such a long topic already that I wanted to devote an entire post to it.
