Just recently I had the opportunity to go to my [alma mater](http://www.calpoly.edu/) to speak to my former department about Web Standards. While the curriculum has improved since I graduated, the Graphic Design concentration in the [Art &amp; Design](http://artdesign.libart.calpoly.edu/) major is definitely more for print design rather than web design, and the web design track (three courses), doesn't have time to teach web standards (...apparently).

My talk (slides will be posted soon) went well enough -- I was nervous and my slides weren't as perfect as they should have been, so the first half was rushed. However, the second half, I was able to slow down, get into examples and topics I was comfortable with, and for the students [about 15, about 7 paying attention (ah, college)], it probably became a lot more enjoyable.

Since I was only able to go into the basics of Web Standards, I promised to post the list of resources for them to look at after if they need more information. If you see anything major that I am missing, let me know in the comments.
