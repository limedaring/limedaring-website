excerpt: I spent six years working on my business before hiring a virtual assistant and now I couldn't imagine life without her. Here's what I've learned.

For the past seven years, I’ve been working on [WeddingLovely](http://weddinglovely.com/), a wedding vendor marketplace and planning guide. WeddingLovely brings in revenue, but not enough to pay myself (or anyone else in North America) full-time, but enough revenue to be significant.

For quite a few years of working on this business (a true labor of love), I answered all emails, posted all blog posts on our [popular weddings blog](http://weddinglovely.com/blog/) (which run one to three times daily), manually approved all small-businesses that joined our directories, not to mention that I’m also the designer and developer for all eleven separate WeddingLovely properties.

**I did everything myself because I love what I built, but also because I couldn’t hire someone to do it for me full-time. I thought this was what I had to do.**

I had heard about virtual assistants from sources like the Four Hour Work Week book, but the days of easy-to-work-with-and-cheap virtual assistants seemed to be over. Companies like [Zirtual](https://www.zirtual.com/) *start* at $398 for just 12 hours per month, when I really needed something like 12 hours per week. **When my business is so low income that I struggle to pay myself, there is no way I can pay $400 for three hours a week.**

Most “we’ll help you find a virtual assistant” services also all seemed to start at $50/hour at minimum. Of course, since I needed someone to write emails on my behalf, I needed fluency in English, so I mistakenly thought that I would require a virtual assistant located in North America who would charge rates I couldn’t afford.

Last but not least, there are a lot of services that, for a fee, would help you find a Philippines-based assistant. I worried about paying fees to a middleman (most seem to be around $500), being cut out from the process, and being “matched” with someone who didn’t work out.

Cutting to the end of the story: Today I work with a truly amazing woman in the Philippines. She works for me full-time for a price that I can afford and does great work. **After so many failed starts, how did I finally successfully find a virtual assistant?**

Here’s the process that worked for me:

## Start documenting everything in detail.

First, **I started documenting the tasks I’d like to outsource and these documents proved invaluable in hiring a new assistant.**

I used Google Drive and Google Docs to write and hold all documentation and walkthroughs for my tasks:

_For my sanity, tasks are also grouped in folders._

Each of these documents goes into detail in bullet points the exact processes that the task requires:

_I find bullets easier for instructions (rather than paragraphs), and I try to add images wherever possible._

Note the video link! I started informally video-ing my processes and sticking them into a private YouTube account, and the combination of written and video walkthroughs has made on-boarding more efficient with less confusion.

Last but not least, all of these tasks are added to one main document showing what I need done daily, weekly, monthly, and as needed, with links to the specific task pages. I added to this list tasks that haven’t been started yet (highlighted in yellow) so my assistant won’t be caught off-guard when more tasks get added to her plate.

The process of writing the above sheet, breaking down everything I needed done into daily/monthly/weekly/as-needed tasks, and then building the individual documentation and walkthrough pages, **helped me get my head around exactly what I needed done and made the process of hiring and working with someone 1000% times easier.**

## Skip the recruiters and middlemen — try forums.

I eventually stumbled on the website [OnlineJobs.ph](https://www.onlinejobs.ph/) and was swayed that I could post a job advertisement without paying — you pay only when you want to view applicants.

I wrote up a job ad, posted, and waited… and didn’t wait too long, **as after two hours I had 80 responses.**

I was overwhelmed already, so I turned off the ad, paid OnlineJob’s $49 fee, and started going through applications.

## Create a test (and pay your test-takers for their time)

Since I had already created my list of tasks, it was easy to pull out a few small ones and create a test from them. I built some sample businesses and a sample blog post that would need to be posted on social media, then passed them on to about ten of my top applicants with the documentation I had already created. I asked the applicants to send me what they would respond with, as well as track the time it took them to determine the correct responses. I took both quality as well as speed into account when “scoring” the responses I received.

I also made it clear I needed the time spent working on my test so I could pay them for their time, which I did at a flat $12/hour, higher than all of their posted hourly rates. I wanted to incentivize the applicants to give me their actual time spent on my test, and also because **spec work sucks**. Most took about 30 mins on my test, so paying folks for their time really didn’t cost me much.

## Figure out what is really important to you.

WeddingLovely’s brand is deliberately down-to-earth, informal, and a little bit goofy. It’s rare that I send an email to a business without using an exclamation mark, smilie, or emoji. Surrounded by formal, uptight wedding businesses, I’ve deliberately made WeddingLovely a breath of fresh air.

In my responses, I received so many applications with applicants with very, very, very low rates — which was tempting—but their applications didn’t “feel” on-brand to me.

One applicant sent me a message, and I responded using my usual informal manner, using :) and !’s. Her response to me copied my manner, a different style than her original message.

*Bingo.*

**She had a rate I could afford, great work on my test, and most importantly, she was aware of language styles and was able to pick up on my style without me asking for it.** This was the person I wanted to hire.

## Start part-time.

We started with part-time hours, paying through PayPal monthly. I started her on the tasks we did the test on during the application process, and I slowly introduced new tasks as things settled down and we established a process.

After a few months it was clear we worked well together, and we moved her to a full-time schedule.

Starting slow made it less chaotic on-boarding her, and allowed me to feel more comfortable letting go of all the pieces of the business I used to run. Worse case, I could have discovered that things weren’t working out and run another ad for a new assistant, and now that I had my process down and my documentation written, that prospect was much less daunting than it was before.

---

I couldn’t imagine running WeddingLovely now without my virtual assistant.

I wish I hired her four years ago, rather than less-than-a-year ago, as not only has my time freed up to allow me to do more design and development work, **2016 was WeddingLovely’s best year ever, crushing revenue goals.** This is something I can only attribute to the small-businesses on WeddingLovely getting more attention than they did when I was doing everything, and therefore choosing voluntarily to move to a paid account without me spending time on any kind of sales process.

To review:

* Hiring a virtual assistant is one of the best things I’ve done for my business and I wish I did it earlier.
* Figure out what tasks could reasonably be outsourced.
* Documenting everything is crucial for on-boarding (and is good practice anyways.)
* Look at lesser-known sources like forums for finding virtual assistants.
* Money shouldn’t be the top factor — try to determine a factor that is unique to your business and hire someone who fits.
* Start slowly and don’t be afraid to try a new person if the first person hired doesn’t work out (since you have that documentation already written.)
* It’s also pretty awesome being able to provide a livable wage to someone, even if they’re not in the same country as me.
