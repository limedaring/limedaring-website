I've been working on Hello Web App ([http://hellowebapp.com](http://hellowebapp.com)) for over a year now — it was around November 2013 when I started pondering the idea about writing my own book, after years of figuring out Django on my own and being annoyed at existing tutorials.

It's been a long journey. From Kickstarter, to writing, to revising, to revising again, to marketing, and finally — Hello Web App can be bought from Gumroad ([http://gumroad.com/limedaring](http://gumroad.com/limedaring)), Amazon ([http://amzn.to/1yLsHFH](http://amzn.to/1yLsHFH)), or Leanpub ([https://leanpub.com/hellowebapp/](https://leanpub.com/hellowebapp/)).

_(FYI Amazon is showing the paperback book as being out of stock. I have been fighting with their automated system but they still didn't order enough. It should be back in stock by the end of the week, and I encourage you to order today even though it's out of stock so Amazon will learn to order more from me at a time. Gumroad paperback orders will be shipped by yours truly on Wednesday.)_

Ridiculously happy to have my book finally released to the public. Appreciate any feedback anyone has (and Amazon reviews of course!)
