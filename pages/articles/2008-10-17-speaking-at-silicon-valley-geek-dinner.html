Hey, it's my very first speaking engagement! Sadly, I'm not talking about anything REALLY awesome; I'll be expanding a bit on multivariate testing, the stuff I do at work and how it has worked for the sites I manage. I promise to make it more interesting than it sounds.




This dinner is being held at [Amarin Thai](http://www.amarinthaicuisine.com/home.html) in Mountain View, on Tuesday, October 21, 2008, at 7:00pm.
