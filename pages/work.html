<p><strong>I like building stuff.</strong></p>

<p>My background, in a nutshell: My background is in design (BFA Art &amp; Design from Cal Poly SLO), and I've been building websites since I was 11. My first job was leading design and front-end development for a startup,then I freelanced, then I taught myself Python, launched my own startup, then wrote a couple books on beginner web app development.</p>

<p>Currently I'm a part of the developer relations team at <a href="http://dreamfactory.com">DreamFactory</a>.</p>

<p>My two main side projects:</p>

<h3>Hello Web App</h3>

</a>

<p>I taught myself to code alongside building my startup, and as I became more skilled with programming, I thought about better ways I wish programming (and web app development) could be taught.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://hellowebapp.com"><i>Hello Web App</i></a> is a series of two books teaching programming through web app development</strong> with Django &#8212; the same path I used to teach myself programming. <i>Hello Web App</i> is a tutorial introducing the Python framework Django and walking readers through building and launching a basic web app. <i>Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts</i> teaches more advanced skills and features like adding customer payments, an API, and database design.</p>

<h3>WeddingLovely</h3>

</a>

<p>I built <a href="https://weddinglovely.com">WeddingLovely</a> to teach myself how to code, and it grew into a startup. I was accepted into the <a href="http://designerfund.com">Designer Fund</a> and <a href="http://500.co">500 Startups</a> in 2011 and raised two very small rounds of funding.</p>

<p><strong>WeddingLovely walks customers through planning their wedding and connects them with local and small business wedding vendors.</strong> Today WeddingLovely (and all eleven WeddingLovely web properties) largely run themselves and I act mostly in an advisory position.</p>
