<p>At the moment I am entirely too busy with my job and personal projects to take on any freelance design work, and unfortunately I also don't know any designers looking for work at the moment.</p>

<p>Ping me at <a href="mailto:tracy@limedaring.com">tracy@limedaring.com</a>, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
